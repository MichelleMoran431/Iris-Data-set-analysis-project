###Background###

The Iris flower data set is an example of a multivariate data set developed by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher using data collected by Edgar Anderson, an american biologist.
Fisher developed a linear discrimnant model to distinguish between the species of Iris.

###The Data Set###

The data set consists of 50 samples of each class of Iris, 150 rows and 4 columns of data : 

Data Set Class and Attributes details:

1. Class
    *Iris Setosa
    *Iris Versicolor
    *Iris Virginica
2. Attributes
    *sepal length in cm
    *sepal width in cm
    *petal length in cm
    *petal width in 



####Download the data set and add it to a Repository####

GITHUB URL : https://github.com/g00387856/Iris-Data-set-analysis-project.git

Data set downloaded from the UCI - Machine Learning Repository, center for machine learning and intelligent systems. It is saved as a txt.file called Irisdataset.txt , an example of a CSV file.

3. Write a Program called analysis.py to do the follow : 
  
    1. -  **Outputs a summary of each variable to a single text file**
    
      1.1  - Import modules : **CSV and Pandas** - Using Pandas to call up "Irisdataset.txt" from desktop folder. 
          Create a df ( dataframe) - associating data from the Irisdataset.txt
          Pandas is used for working with tabular data e.g. CSV files , by creating dataframes. 
          
      1.2  - Identify the column headings and add the columns headings as attributes to the dataframe (df)
      1.3 -  Using the **describe()** to give a statistical summary output for each variable -
      
      count    150.000000   150.000000    150.000000   150.000000
      mean       5.843333     3.054000      3.758667     1.198667
      std        0.828066     0.433594      1.764420     0.763161
       min        4.300000     2.000000      1.000000     0.100000
      25%        5.100000     2.800000      1.600000     0.300000
      50%        5.800000     3.000000      4.350000     1.300000
      75%        6.400000     3.300000      5.100000     1.800000
      max        7.900000     4.400000      6.900000     2.500000
  
      1.4  - **print(df.head())** - Returns the first 5 rows of the dataframe ( however you can input any no. in the parenthesis not just              5)
      
      <<<<<<< HEAD
     sepal_length  sepal_width  petal_length  petal_width     class
       0             5.1          3.5           1.4          0.2  setosa
       1             4.9          3.0           1.4          0.2  setosa
       2             4.7          3.2           1.3          0.2  setosa
        3            4.6          3.1           1.5          0.2  setosa
        4            5.0          3.6           1.4          0.2  setosa
        
      **1.5  - print(desc ,file = open("Summary File", "a"))** 
        Prints the outputs which is the summary results to a txt. file called "Summary File". 
        It was realised that everytime the "analysis.py" file was saved and ran , it updated the summary file. By updating this file, it         repeated the statistical summary output for each variable and the head information. 
        To overcome this , even though it could be deemed as expected error, a time stamp could be added or before making the last        commit to git hub deleting all the duplicate entries leaving just one representation.

     2. Create a histogram of each variable to png files
     
     Firstly to define what Histograms is : it is a visual tool for quickly assessing the probability distribution ( or PDF - Probability density function. For the IRIS dataset - the histogram represents the probability distribution of each of the variabelse for each of the species.In python , the histograms Y axis tells the count of flower at a particular x axis or how often they come at this value. 
Below is the code for creating a histogram of a variable :

Import module **matplotlib.pyplot as plt**
Where we assign the variable to x and use plt.hist to create histogram. 

plt.title ("Sepal Length in cm")
x = df["**Variable**"]
plt.hist( x, bins = 20, color = "green", edgecolor="black") 
plt.xlabel("Sepal_Length_cm") 
plt.ylabel("Count")
plt.savefig ("sepal_length.png")
plt.clf()
